synopsis: A cross-platform, cross-console way to handle echoing terminal input
description:
    The @base@ library exposes the @hGetEcho@ and @hSetEcho@ functions
    for querying and setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither
    function works with MinTTY consoles on Windows. This is a serious
    issue, since @hGetEcho@ and @hSetEcho@ are often used to disable
    input echoing when a program prompts for a password, so many
    programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!
    .
    This library provides an alternative interface which works
    with both MinTTY and other consoles. An example is included
    which demonstrates how one might prompt for a password using
    this library. To build it, make sure to configure with the
    @-fexample@ flag.
