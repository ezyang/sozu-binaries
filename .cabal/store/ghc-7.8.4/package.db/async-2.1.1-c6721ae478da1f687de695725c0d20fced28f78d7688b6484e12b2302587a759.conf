synopsis: Run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results
description:
    This package provides a higher-level interface over
    threads, in which an @Async a@ is a concurrent
    thread that will eventually deliver a value of
    type @a@.  The package provides ways to create
    @Async@ computations, wait for their results, and
    cancel them.
    .
    Using @Async@ is safer than using threads in two
    ways:
    .
    * When waiting for a thread to return a result,
    if the thread dies with an exception then the
    caller must either re-throw the exception
    ('wait') or handle it ('waitCatch'); the
    exception cannot be ignored.
    .
    * The API makes it possible to build a tree of
    threads that are automatically killed when
    their parent dies (see 'withAsync').
